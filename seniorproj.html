                        <p>I can almost say that I've acheived the applha version of my project. The frontend of the website is finished and the photobooth/webcam feature is almost done. The only issue I'm having is displaying the captured image which I will have to smooth out my backend design to do. I also have to figure out this aspect in order to connect to the thermal printer (which arrived in the mail after midterm presentations).</p>
                        <br>   
                        <p>I want to give myself a deadline of April 10th to workout the backend and image saving feature in order to give myself enough time to finish the printer connection. If I'm not able to meet this dealine I will have to scrpa the printer aspect because I don't work the work to be rushed and compromise on quality. I'm a bit concered because I haven't been able to find any similar queries/project online. I even asked in different forums and reached out to a former professor and no one has been able to help me figure out the right method to do this.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>During midterm feedback the people in my group answered some of the questions I presented and suggested that I keep some aspect of my original vintage mac design for the 'photobooth' page from my low-res prototpe demo (pictured below). I initially wanted to scrap this UI because its an outdated aesthetic from a specific period in time and I wanted the website to be more timeless since it would be displaying images from a large range of time periods. However, after hearing feedback from my group I decided to implement the vintage mac UI. I believe it would make sense in the context of the gallery page which has a polaroid display. Some other changes I'll be making are adding caption to the gallery images in handwritten script like real polaroid pictures, and allowing each picture to be clicked on to enlarge/enhance it in the window.</p>

                        <p>We presented our Cultural Environment assignment and it was interesteing to hear who people did their research on. 
                        As for project progress, I applied to the makerspace mini grant but didn't hear back so I just went ahead and ordered the physical materials I would need myself. I'm thinking about the presentation of my project during the showcase and I think it would be cool to build a foamboard/carboard piece that kind of mimicks a photobooth, something similar to the image below that I found on pinterest. However this is not a top priority for me so I will only begin to work on this when all the components of my project are running smoothly.</p>

                            After finishing my project plan document, I was able to find to comprehensive tutorials that are almost idnetical to my project idea! I've also compiled a list of the physical materials I'll need and plan to apply to the makerspace mini grant for them, but first I need to make part one of my MVP which is the software aspect. I've given myself till feb 27th to finish a working full stack website that can capture a webcam image and save it to a folder for it to be converted to a bitmap for the thermal printer.

                            I also had a first meeting with my accountability group this week and came up with a new idea for the interface of the website which is inspired by the NintendoDS camera feature:

                            I've created a task list for current and future tasks related to my project. I'm really excited to start building and have already been doing some research on what technologies I'll have to utuilize to make this idea work. Working on the project plan gave me a burst of motivation and also helped the reality of this task set in.

                            I found a help thread from 2016 about someone who wanted to print images w/ a thermal printer + arduino like I want to, and honestly––it seems complicated, but I have a lot of time and I'm glad to know that it's even possible

                            As a creative technologist I seek to merge the disciplines of design, technology, and computing to create unique experiences that human beings can share with one another, rather than products that simply exist for consumption.

                            The human experience is inherently tied to nature, and thus the beauty of the collective journey as well as the expression of the natural laws of our world should emanate from my work.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Duality and opposites are prominent themes in our universe; zeros and ones, light and dark, yes and no, and the space in between these pairs is infinite. It is within this space that my work finds its sandbox–unearthing the polarity of the human condition, bringing it to light in new ways and amongst various contexts that remind us of who we are and where we come from.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Elements of language, sound, and color are essential in bringing out the flavors of life’s journey and they work together like a three-stranded chord to reflect various emotions and events. This cord is not easily broken and can withstand the medium of time to leave lasting impressions in our minds. 
                            Discourse within our individual selves and with others about a work of craftsmanship keep the wheels of progress turning as communities and opinions form around beliefs and experiences. This adds to the beauty and meaning of whatever work prompted the dialogue.
