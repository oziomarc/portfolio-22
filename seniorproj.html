                            As a creative technologist I seek to merge the disciplines of design, technology, and computing to create unique experiences that human beings can share with one another, rather than products that simply exist for consumption.

The human experience is inherently tied to nature, and thus the beauty of the collective journey as well as the expression of the natural laws of our world should emanate from my work.
<br>
<br>
Duality and opposites are prominent themes in our universe; zeros and ones, light and dark, yes and no, and the space in between these pairs is infinite. It is within this space that my work finds its sandbox–unearthing the polarity of the human condition, bringing it to light in new ways and amongst various contexts that remind us of who we are and where we come from.
<br>
<br>
Elements of language, sound, and color are essential in bringing out the flavors of life’s journey and they work together like a three-stranded chord to reflect various emotions and events. This cord is not easily broken and can withstand the medium of time to leave lasting impressions in our minds. 
Discourse within our individual selves and with others about a work of craftsmanship keep the wheels of progress turning as communities and opinions form around beliefs and experiences. This adds to the beauty and meaning of whatever work prompted the dialogue.
